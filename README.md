    <h2>About the day</h2>
    <p>I found a book about Money and thought it was interesting. I read it for a while and learned some facts about financials and the book's name is Psychology of Money. I also start watching a web series. The series was about hacking. Elliot is a brilliant young cyber-security engineer and vigilante hacker. It was an interesting and enjoyable story. I liked the episode and felt inspired by it.
