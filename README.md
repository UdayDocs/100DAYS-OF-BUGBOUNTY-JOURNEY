    <h2>About the day</h2>
    <p>I found a book about Money and thought it was interesting. I read it for a while and learned some facts about financials and the book's name is Psychology of Money. I also start watching a web series. The series was about hacking. Elliot is a brilliant young cyber-security engineer and vigilante hacker. It was an interesting and enjoyable story. I liked the episode and felt inspired by it.

    <p>Yesterday,I mentioned a quote from batman movie.Everyone has limitations and learns to live within them, but I chooses to ignore their own limits  and push beyond them. Remember, you’re limitless.Today is all about completing all the pending tasks. I need to join an environment or community for bug bounty hunting, such as Twitter pages, Discord, Reddit,what not?. Also, I am building a website while learning javascript, DSA in Python. And you know, I’m a calisthenics guy.”
